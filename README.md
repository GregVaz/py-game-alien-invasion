### Planning your project

> In Alien Invasion, the player controls a rocket ship that appears at the bottom center of the screen. The player can move the ship wifht and left using the arrow keys and shoot bullets using the spacebar. When the game begins, a fleet of aliens fills the sky and moves acress and down the creen. The player shoots and destroys the alients. If the player shoots all the aliens, a new fleet appears that moves faster than the previous fleet. If any alien hits the player's ship or reaches the bottom of the screen, the player loses a ship. If the player loses three ships, the game ends.

### Refactoring: The _check_events()_ and _update_screen() methods

In large projects, you will often refactor code you've written before adding more code. Refactoring simplifies the structure of the code you've already written, making it easier to build on.
